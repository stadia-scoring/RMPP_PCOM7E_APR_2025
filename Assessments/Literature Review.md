The Impact of LLMs (Large Language Models) in system risk management assessment and validation
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Claude have shown promise in supporting a range of tasks traditionally reserved for human analysts, including documentation analysis, control mapping, threat identification, and even regulatory interpretation. In enterprise and critical infrastructure settings, early adopters have begun exploring the use of LLMs to assist with system risk management assessments and validation workflows. These experiments range from automating risk report generation to interpreting compliance frameworks like ISO 27001 or NIST SP 800-53.

However, despite the growing application of LLMs, the extent to which these models enhance, undermine, or reshape risk management practices is still unclear. There is limited empirical evidence detailing how LLM-driven support impacts the quality, consistency, or trustworthiness of assessments. Anecdotal reports suggest that while LLMs can accelerate documentation and initial analysis, they may also introduce uncertainty, hallucinate outputs, or lack contextual awareness in highly specialized domains.

This emerging pattern suggests a need for closer empirical study. By observing current uses and evaluating outcomes across various implementations, we can begin to identify themes, benefits, limitations, and risks. These insights will form the foundation for broader theory-building on the role of LLMs in modern system risk management.
