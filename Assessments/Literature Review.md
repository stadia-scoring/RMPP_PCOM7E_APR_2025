## Choosing the Topic for Your Literature Review and Presentation

TOPIC: To what extent can Large Language Models (LLMs) support the automation of Risk Management Framework (RMF) assessment and authorization processes for networked systems within the Department of Defense (DoD), and what are the practical implications for accuracy, compliance, and trust?

Observation for Inductive Research Method

The Department of Defense (DoD) is actively pursuing the integration of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline its cybersecurity risk assessments under the Risk Management Framework (RMF). This initiative aims to expedite the authorization process for software, as highlighted in recent efforts to eliminate traditional RMF procedures for DoD software systems .

While current endeavors primarily target software systems, there is a growing recognition of the potential benefits of applying similar automation strategies to networked systems. The complexity and scale of DoD networks necessitate efficient and reliable risk management processes. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) could play a pivotal role in this context by automating the analysis and validation of RMF artifacts, enhancing the speed and accuracy of risk assessments.

Early observations suggest that LLMs can assist in interpreting complex regulatory documents, generating compliance reports, and identifying potential security vulnerabilities within network configurations. However, the application of LLMs in RMF processes for networked systems remains underexplored. Challenges such as ensuring the accuracy of AI-generated assessments, maintaining transparency in decision-making processes, and addressing potential biases in AI models need to be carefully considered.

Given the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats and the DoD’s commitment to maintaining robust security postures, it is imperative to investigate the applicability and effectiveness of LLMs in automating RMF processes for networked systems. An inductive research approach, grounded in empirical observations and case studies, will provide valuable insights into the practical implications, benefits, and limitations of this integration.
