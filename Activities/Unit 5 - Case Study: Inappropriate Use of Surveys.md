### Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys

In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.

Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.

In 2018, Cambridge Analytica became the center of international controversy when it was revealed they harvested data from millions of Facebook users via seemingly innocuous personality quizzes (Confessore, 2018). While only a few hundred thousand users consented to the survey, the app accessed data from their entire friend network, collecting vast amounts of personal information without direct consent.

### Purpose of the Survey
- Promoted as a harmless psychological test.
- In reality, used to profile users and micro-target them with political advertisements during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and Brexit referendum.

## 2. Additional Examples of Inappropriate Survey Use

### A. TikTok's "In-App Quizzes" for Data Mining (2020–2022)
- TikTok used personality quizzes and "what kind of ___ are you?" games that requested user input and camera/mic access.
- Behind the scenes, some third-party developers were scraping behavioral and biometric data.
- Data was reportedly routed through servers in China, sparking international privacy and security concerns.

### B. Mobile Gaming Surveys and "Rewarded Surveys"
- Popular mobile games (especially freemium ones) often offer rewards for taking "surveys."
- These surveys, hosted by third parties, extract detailed demographic, financial, and behavioral data under the guise of in-game rewards.
- Users often agree to terms without understanding the scope of data sharing, sometimes including geolocation, purchase history, or ad preferences.

## 3. Ethical, Social, Legal, and Professional Impacts

| Perspective | Impact |
|------------------|------------|
| Ethical | - Lack of informed consent violates users' autonomy.<br>- Deception: Users were misled about the true purpose of the surveys.<br>- Exploitation of user trust and behavior for profit or influence. |
| Social | - Erodes public trust in technology platforms.<br>- Encourages cynicism and disengagement with digital platforms.<br>- Contributed to political manipulation, polarization, and misinformation. |
| Legal | - Violations of data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, FTC regulations).<br>- Resulted in fines (e.g., Facebook fined £500,000 in the UK, later larger settlements in the U.S.).<br>- Prompted legal reforms and inquiries on data ethics. |
| Professional | - Breach of professional codes of conduct in data science, marketing, and software development.<br>- Undermines credibility of research and legitimate survey tools.<br>- Highlights the need for ethical training in tech professions. |
