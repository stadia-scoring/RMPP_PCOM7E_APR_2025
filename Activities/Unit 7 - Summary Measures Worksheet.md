`Exe 8.1B.xlsx`

Sample Size, Mean, and Standard Deviation of Weight Loss for Diet B:

| Metric                      | Value       |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Sample Size (n)            | 50          |
| Sample Mean Weight Loss    | 3.710 kg    |
| Sample Standard Deviation  | 2.769 kg    |

Interpretation:

Compared to Diet A (mean = 5.341 kg, std = 2.536 kg), Diet B appears to be less effective in terms of average weight loss. The greater spread (standard deviation) in Diet B also suggests more variability in how participants responded to the diet.

| Metric                                | Value       |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| Median Weight Loss (Q2)              | 3.745 kg    |
| First Quartile (Q1)                  | 1.953 kg    |
| Third Quartile (Q3)                  | 5.404 kg    |
| Interquartile Range (IQR)            | 3.450 kg    |

Interpretation:

The median weight loss for Diet B is lower than Diet A’s median (5.642 kg). This suggests that Diet A was more effective for the majority of participants. The IQR for Diet B is slightly larger (3.450 kg vs 3.285 kg for Diet A), indicating somewhat more variability among the middle 50% of participants.

Frequencies and Percentage Frequencies of Brand Preferences – Area 2:

| Brand  | Frequency | Percentage |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| A      | 19        | 21.1%      |
| B      | 30        | 33.3%      |
| Other  | 41        | 45.6%      |
| Total | 90    | 100.0%  |

Interpretation:

In Area 2, the most preferred option is “Other” brands (45.6%), followed by Brand B (33.3%) and Brand A (21.1%). Compared to Area 1 (where "Other" accounted for 60.0% and Brand A was the least preferred), Area 2 shows a more even distribution of preferences, and a stronger inclination toward Brand B.
