## Title: Case Study on Privacy

### The Case

Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.

Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.

Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?

### If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?

No, he should not.

Ethical Issues:
-	Unauthorized Disclosure: Ricardo is not authorized to release personally identifiable information (PII), which could violate privacy expectations and legal regulations.
-	Professional Responsibility: As a clerk, Ricardo is obligated to follow policies and confidentiality rules of his department.
-	Trust and Integrity: Violating protocol erodes institutional trust and may lead to disciplinary action or legal consequences.

### Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?

If Ricardo has discretion over access decisions, he must act ethically and within the bounds of policy.

Ethical Issues:
- Balancing Research and Privacy: He must weigh public benefit of research against potential privacy invasion.
-	Informed Consent: Individuals should ideally provide consent before their data is used.
-	Transparency and Fairness: Decisions must follow consistent, publicly known policy—not personal discretion.
-	Precedent and Policy: Allowing access outside normal procedure could set a dangerous precedent or violate existing agreements.

 
### Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?

This raises serious privacy and consent considerations.

Ethical Issues for the Records Department:
-	Respect for Autonomy: Individuals should control how and by whom their personal data is used.
-	Risk of Harm or Intrusion: Unsolicited contact may feel invasive or cause distress.
-	Legal Compliance: Releasing PII may violate data protection laws such as GDPR or HIPAA.
-	Gatekeeping Responsibility: The department is a steward of public data, not an agent for researchers.
-	Alternative Methods: Anonymous or indirect outreach methods may better respect privacy.

  
### Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?

One-third give permission, one-third deny it, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims she needs at least 50% participation.

Options Available to Beth:
-	Discontinue or Modify the Study: If she cannot ethically meet sample requirements, she may need to alter or abandon the research.
- Send Follow-Ups: A second outreach may be permitted, but must avoid coercion or pressure.
- Revise the Study Design: Adjust methodology to use only the consenting participants.
- Collaborate with Records Department: Explore permitted recruitment strategies.
- Consult Ethics Review Board: Seek guidance from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or equivalent authority.
