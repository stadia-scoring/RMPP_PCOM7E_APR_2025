## Action Plan

1. **Short-Term (1–3 months)**:
   - Finalize and organize e-Portfolio with artefacts from Units 6–9.
   - Identify one leadership or cross-team opportunity at work to contribute to.
   - Refine documentation and GitHub usage for code/artefacts.

2. **Mid-Term (3–6 months)**:
   - Take a certification in risk management or cyber threat intelligence.
   - Contribute to a policy-oriented working group (e.g., Zero Trust, AI ethics).
   - Explore mentorship opportunities to support newer analysts.

3. **Long-Term (6–12 months)**:
   - Present an internal white paper on ethical AI risk in defensive cybersecurity.
   - Pursue postgraduate-level research into AI-driven compliance automation.
   - Apply for a strategic or team lead position within the organization.

## Reflective Piece (3Ws Model)

### What?
In Unit 1, I explored global AI ethics and governance, focusing on the tension between innovation and responsible use of generative AI. I reflected on the ethical frameworks and international divergence in regulations. As someone in cybersecurity, the topic immediately felt relevant—not only in theory, but in the practical decisions I make daily.

### So What?
This was a pivotal reflection because it moved beyond theoretical frameworks into my actual sphere of work. My job in defensive cybersecurity involves making real-time decisions that affect user safety and data integrity. The recognition that algorithms, threat detection, and telemetry data all carry embedded assumptions—and potential biases—was eye-opening. This confirmed my belief that ethics cannot be abstract in our field. The reflective process also validated that I can bridge conceptual thinking and operational decision-making.

### What Next?
Moving forward, I plan to build on this insight by integrating ethical checkpoints into the systems and tools I manage. Whether implementing telemetry filters or recommending AI threat detection platforms, I now assess not only technical performance but also ethical impact. I’ll continue to review emerging AI legislation, maintain active dialogue in professional forums, and aim to influence ethical cybersecurity practices more broadly.
