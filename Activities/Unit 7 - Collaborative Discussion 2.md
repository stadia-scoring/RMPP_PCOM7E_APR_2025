Initial Post

The case of Abi raises several ethical, legal, and professional issues relevant to computing and research professionals, particularly concerning data integrity and the responsible communication of findings.

First and foremost, while Abi may not be altering data, selectively choosing statistical analyses to produce a favorable interpretation constitutes a form of data manipulation through omission. According to the ACM Code of Ethics (2018), computing professionals are expected to “avoid harm” and “be honest and trustworthy.” Presenting only analyses that favor the client, despite valid evidence to the contrary, would breach these principles by misleading stakeholders and potentially endangering public health.

Abi has an ethical obligation to present all valid findings, both positive and negative, especially when public welfare is concerned. The Royal Statistical Society’s Code of Conduct emphasizes that statisticians must present findings “clearly, comprehensively and objectively.” Likewise, the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct urges professionals to act in the public interest and not knowingly mislead.

Abi’s suspicion that the manufacturer will only publish the positive results does not absolve him of responsibility. In fact, foreknowledge of potential misuse strengthens his ethical obligation to document his concerns. One possible course of action is to include a disclaimer or cover letter that contextualizes all findings and highlights the risks of selective reporting.

Legally, misleading marketing based on selectively reported data may fall afoul of consumer protection laws, such as the UK’s Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 or the US Federal Trade Commission’s guidelines on deceptive advertising. Abi could be seen as complicit if he knowingly enables such deception.

Socially, releasing misleading nutritional claims can erode public trust in scientific research and the tech professionals who support it. Professionally, it could damage Abi’s reputation and undermine the credibility of his institution.

In conclusion, while statistical tools can be used to support multiple interpretations, ethical practice demands transparency, balance, and a commitment to public good. Abi must uphold integrity not just in how data is collected, but in how it is analysed and communicated.
