## Initial Post: Application of Ethical Codes in the Malware Disruption Case

The *Malware Disruption* case from the ACM (2020) highlights a scenario where a cybersecurity professional considers disabling malware being controlled by a known criminal group. While the intent is to protect victims and disrupt criminal activity, doing so without proper legal authority or coordination raises significant ethical, legal, and professional concerns.

According to the ACM Code of Ethics, Principle 1.2—*Avoid harm*—is central to this case. Disabling malware could arguably prevent harm to users, but unauthorized intervention risks unintended consequences, such as data loss or system outages for innocent third parties. Principle 2.5—*Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks*—also applies. The individual’s decision to act alone undermines due diligence and transparency, potentially causing more harm than good (ACM, 2018).

In comparison, the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct emphasizes *public interest* and *professional competence*. Section 1(b) of the BCS Code urges members to act “with due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing,” but also stresses adherence to legal frameworks (BCS, 2023). Acting without jurisdictional authority violates both sets of ethical standards.

This case raises broader legal issues, including jurisdiction, digital sovereignty, and potential violations of anti-hacking laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the U.S. or the Computer Misuse Act in the UK. Socially, while the intent may seem virtuous, vigilante cybersecurity undermines public trust in the rule of law and the legitimacy of cybersecurity professionals.

Ultimately, professionalism in computing requires not only ethical intent but ethical process—one that respects legal boundaries, procedural accountability, and collaborative intervention.
